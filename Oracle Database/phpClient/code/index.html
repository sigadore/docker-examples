<H2>Something even more exciting</H2>
<p>Click <a href="./index.php">Here</a> to see some dynamic php</p>

<H2>What about some SQL?</H2>
<p>Adjustments to the sqlquery.php file might be helpful, however, it starting with a connection error
might be just what we want to have happen, until a Wallet or tnsnames.ora has been properly set
up along with enabling the Oracle Demo Data.</p>

<p>Click <a href="./sqlquery.php">SQL SAMPLE QUERY</a> to try out the php-oci8 and Oracle Instant Client
configuration and how well that matches an Oracle Database you have access to.</p>
